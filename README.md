# Hotel-Aggregator
Hi, it is nice for me to share my latest Power Bi project in Mentorness Internship with you. This project is about a hotel aggregator.
First of all, I decided to read what the requirements are and go to data to explore it.
- Data Understanding: Understanding the columns and what it is contained. Honestly, it was the difficult step to be achieved. The columns names did not represent what it was in it So, I should have to understand it all and then call it by the right name.
- Data Cleaning: Dealing with missing data. Some of it needed to be inferred by finding out the outliers, modes, means, SDs â€¦ ect. A group of the other needed to be informed from the main source and the another could not be inferred with no problem if it is let blank.
- Data Analysis: After preparing the data, we should to analyze it, find patterns and answer the questions.
-Data Visualization: In the end, I visualize every answer I get from the data by a chart to help others understanding the data easily and notice what I found.

Thanks for reading. I hope I made the explanation simple and concise.
